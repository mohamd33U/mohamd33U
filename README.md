I love computer vision and deep learning because I believe they have the power to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. My goal is to create new algorithms that push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of AI. Currently, I am working on several projects related to object detection, facial recognition, and security systems. I am excited to share my journey and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Let's connect and make an impact together!
